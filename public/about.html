<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Natacha but I prefer Nat, I'm 22 years old, turning 23 really soon,
  I live in Brasil, in the state of Santa Catarina at the Capital, I live with
  my grandparents and I have one brother that's younger than me.

  Until recently I had no idea what to study and what my passion was or
  something I was really good at, until I met someone who introduced me to the
  vast universe of technology and more specifically, web development.

<p>
  After seeing how websites really worked and really enjoying learning and
  having fun with what I was doing, I was sure that this is what I want to do
  and I identified with it since the first moment.
